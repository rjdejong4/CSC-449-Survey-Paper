## Abstract:
Remote sensing, an application of machine vision, is a popular and widely used technology for environmental monitoring and prediction. This paper will focus on the impact remote sensing has on environmental conservation, its various applications, and how this technology can be used to prevent the further degradation of our precious ecosystem due to climate change. This survey introduces the concept and history of satellite imagery for those new to the topic, its history and development, and demonstrates some examples of its use for sustainability, in hopes to bring awareness and spark interest to this important, and relevant, application. There are four methods of remote sensing for environmental protection that will be discussed which are a 3-dimensional polynomial model to better account for fluctuations in the Earth's terrain for generating truth data, surface roughness modeling of bodies of water, datasets and deep learning models for cloud coverage segmentation, and fire forecasting models.
